      <h2>Research interests</h1>

        <p>
          The main research interest of my team is the <b>theory of quantum many-body non-equilibrium physics</b>.
          We're interested in advancing our fundamental understanding of complex quantum dynamics in large many-body models, by utilizing state-of-the-art
          <b>numerical methods</b> and <b>quantum optics</b> tools [e.g.: matrix product states (MPS)/tensor
          networks, discrete truncated Wigner approximations (DTWA), quantum trajectories, adiabatic elimination, ...].
         Our research not only seeks new insight into <b>fundmantal large-scale quantum theory</b> (e.g. entanglement dynamics),
         but also finds applications in various experimental setups in <b>condensed matter</b>, <b>cold atoms</b>, <b>quantum computers</b>, and sometimes <b>even chemistry</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>Numerical methods for fundamental quantum many-body theory</h3>

          We are interested in developing <b>new types of numerical methods</b> for simulating
          and understanding quantum many-body dynamics on classical computers. In quantum mechanics, the Hilbert space
          grows exponentially with the number of particles. Remarkably, it
          is still <b>not</b> necessarily just the size of the system that makes a quantum evolution hard
          to simulate on a classical computer. Rather it is the amount of quantum entanglement in
          an evolution that can be linked to the question of "classical simulability".
          We are experts in so-called <b>matrix product state (MPS)/tensor network</b> techniques, which is
          a numerical approach for simulating quantum many-body evolution on truncated Hilbert spaces
          with restricted entanglement. A main recent research focus lies e.g. on finding a better 
          understanding on how noise limits large-scale entanglement.
          In addition we are experts in new types of semi-classical phase
          space approaches, e.g. we developed a so-called <b>discrete truncated Wigner approximation</b>. It is based on the
          well-known truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), but adapted to discrete many-body
          models, utilizing a novel type of sampling of quantum noise from discrete (Wigner) distributions.

        <h3>Dynamics and disorder in cavity-coupled molecules</h3>

        <img src="res/molcav.png" width="550" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
        [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-00892-5" target="_blank">see e.g. Commun Phys 5, 120 (2022)</a>]

        <p style="margin-bottom:40">
          A cavity is (typcially) an arrangement of mirrors that fix the boundary
          condition for a particular mode of the electromagnetic field (e.g. for an optical or a microwave photon).
          If a resonant emitter inside a cavity emitts a photon, it
          remains trapped around the emitter. For sufficiently good cavities the emitter and the cavity-mode
          then exchange energy more quickly than they can both dissipate it.
          Such a scenario is denoted as <b>strong coupling</b>, and in strong coupling
          regimes the emitters and the cavity-mode have to be considered as one single entity with
          new hybridized modes. Experiments in Strasbourg
          (<a href="https://nano.isis.unistra.fr" target="_blank">Laboratoire des nanostructures</a>, T. W. Ebbesen)
          have pioneered the idea of strongly and <b>collectively coupling transitions in molecular
          ensembles to cavities</b> (or other types of resonant modes), and shown that this can lead
          to a modification of chemical reactivity or other material properties. We are interested
          in exploring many-body dynamics in <b>minimal quantum optics models</b> for systems of
          cavity-coupled many-body systems, to <b>shed light on physical mechanisms
          behind such experimental observations</b>.

        <h3>Applications in cold atoms</h3>

        <p align = "center" style="margin-bottom:20;margin-top:20; text-align:center;">

        [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09699-5" target="_blank">see e.g. Nature Communications 10, 1714 (2019)</a>]
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past years, technological progress has made it possible to cool atoms
          (with lasers) to extremely low temperatures, and to trap them in controllable optical
          potentials (in so-called "optical lattices" or "optical tweezers"), e.g. in experiments
          in Strasborg (<a href="https://eqm.unistra.fr/" target="_blank">Exotic quantum matter laboratory</a>,
          S. Whitlock). We are interested in theoretically modeling dynamics of such systems of "interacting atoms
          trapped in crystals of light''. Being well isolated from any type of environment, such setups
          allow a controlled experimental observation of (almost) coherent quantum many-body evolution
          with interactions. We are interested in utilizing such new setups for studying <b>fundamental
          effects in quantum many-body non-equilibrium theory</b> (e.g. entanglement growth,
          thermalization and localization, super- and subradiance, synchronization, driven-dissipative
          dynamics, time-dependent preparation of strongly-correlated phases of matter, ...) and to
          analyze their prospect for future applications in analog and digital
          <b>quantum simulation & computation</b>.
